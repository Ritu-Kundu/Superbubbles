  /** Class Subgraph
   * A subgraph(G) is special graph obtained from a part of the original graph(H).
   * @see Graph.
   *
   * A vertex in a subgraph is given a new vertex-id called 'local-id'. Its original id in the graph(H) from which this subgraph is obtained is called 'global-id'.
   *
   * This class maintains the global-id of each of its vertices by maintaining an array. It is the responsibility of the original graph(H) to set the global-ids of the vertices in this subgraph.
   * 
   *
   * This class also provides for obtaining the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG), G', using the algorithm described in the paper "An O(m log m) -time Algorithm For Detecting Superbubbles" by Sung et al. This class is reponsible for creating and destroying its DAG.
   *  - For obtaining a DAG from a subgraph, method requires to create two vertices(u' and u'') for each vertex(u) in the subgraph except for source(r) and terminal/sink(r'). A source and a terminal are also added to this DAG. Then edges are added to DAG depending on some conditions (see the paper).
   *    -- Let offset is equal to the number of vertices(except r and r') in the subgraph.
   *       --- Thus, in a DAG of the subgpah, number of vertices = 2 * offset + 2
   *       --- This class approaches this 'duplication' of vertices by considering u and u' have same local-ids in the subgraph and its DAG while u'' has an id(called duplicate-local-id)) equal to (id of u + offset). To summarise,
   *           Id of u'(in G') = Id of u(in G)
   *           Id of u''(in G') = Id of u(in G) + offset
   *       --- Just like in G, G' also has source and terminal/sink vertices having ids equal to the second-last and last indices of the vertices respectively.
   *
   * It also assists in reporting 'real' superbubbles found in its DAG by providing the following:
   *  - Answering the following queries:
   *    -- Id of u'' for a vertex u' in G'.
   *    -- Does a given id of G' correspond to a duplicate u'' of some u'.
   *    -- Id of u' for some dplicate vertex u'' in G'.
   *    -- Offset of this subgraph. (as id of every u' is in the range[0, offset))
   *  - It also maintains the dicovery and finishing times of the vertices in its DFS traversal to answer queries of the form: Is vertex x an ancesstor of vertex y?
   *
   * To conclude, this class provides for the following:
   *  - Setting global-id of a vertex.
   *  - Quering the global-id of a vertex. 
   *  - Generating underlying DAG G:
   *  - Assisting in reporting the 'real' superbubbles by providing functions to query the follwing:
   *    -- Id of u'' for a vertex u' in G'.
   *    -- Id of u' for some dplicate vertex u'' in G'.
   *    -- Does some given id of G' correspond to a duplicate u''?
   *    -- Is a vertex x an ancesstor of a vertex y? 
   *    -- Offset of this subgraph. (as id of every u' is in the range[0, offset))
