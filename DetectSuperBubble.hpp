  /** Class DetectSuperBubble
   *
   * It defines the functions to implement the following:
   *  - 1.Partitioning a general graph(H) into subgraphs (Gs). 
   *  - 2.Converting a cyclic subgraph(G) into acyclic(G').
   *  - 3.Detecting superbubbles in a single-source and single-sink DAG.
   *  - 4.Filtering out 'unreal' superbubbles. (Conversion to acyclic requires duplication of parts of the subgraph which may result into some superbubbles('unreal') detetected that occur in parts which do not belong to the original subgraph G.)
   * Steps 1, 2 and 4 are described in the paper(paper-1) "An O(m log m) -time Algorithm For Detecting Superbubbles" by Sung et al.
   * Step 3 is implemented as described in the paper 
(paper-2) "Linear-Time Superbubble Identification Algorithm for  Genome Assembly" by Brankovic et.al.
   *
   * This class provides for the following:
   *  - Finding superbubbles in a generaal directed graph.
