  /** Class Graph
   * A graph is represented as follows:
   *   - A vertex is represented by its vertex-id which is an int.
   *   - Edges between vertices are represented using ajacency list.
   * A vertex and vertex-id are inter-changably used.
   * This class provides for the following:
   *  - Adding edges between vertices.
   *  - Printing the graph in adjacency-list format.
   *  - Support to query the number of vertices, edges; children and parents of a vertex.
   *  - Support to partition the graph into set of subgraphs 
   *    -- This set comprises of the following subgraphs:
   *       --- one corresponding to each of the non-singleton Strongly Connected Component(scc)
   *       --- one which includes every singleton scc(vertex).
